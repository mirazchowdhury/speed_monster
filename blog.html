                What is the main difference between local storage and session storage Mcq?
                The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire,
                whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created
                once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time

                A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code. Local
                Scope — Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope

            <br>
            <p class=" ps-4 ">
                In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is
                not the case, avoid overriding it.)

                A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns
                undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value.

            <br>
            <p class=" ps-4 ">
                The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
                is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
